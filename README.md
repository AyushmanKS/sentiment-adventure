# Sentiment Adventure: A Gamified Journey into AI

**Sentiment Adventure** is a full-stack, interactive web application designed to teach the core concepts of Sentiment Analysis to middle school students (and anyone curious about AI!). Through a fun, story-driven game, users help a friendly robot named Gloomy learn to understand human emotions.

## üöÄ About The Project

The goal of this project was to demystify a complex AI topic by breaking it down into simple, engaging, and interactive steps. Instead of reading dry definitions, users actively participate in Gloomy's training, experiencing the entire sentiment analysis pipeline from start to finish.

The game is structured into 8 distinct levels:

*   **Level 1: Data Collection** - Learning to identify messages that contain feelings.
*   **Level 2: Text Preprocessing** - Cleaning up messy text by removing punctuation and "stop words".
*   **Level 3: Feature Extraction** - Turning words into numbers through scoring and word-counting.
*   **Level 4: Sentiment Classification** - Sorting words and sentences into Positive, Negative, and Neutral bins.
*   **Level 5: Analysis & Interpretation** - Understanding sentiment intensity and the challenges of sarcasm.
*   **Level 6: Visualization & Reporting** - Learning how data is presented with charts and colors.
*   **Level 7: Implementation & Iteration** - Reviewing the whole process and seeing how models are used and improved.
*   **Level 8: Play with Gloomy (Sandbox)** - A final, creative level where users can build their own sentences and get an instant sentiment prediction from the fully-trained Gloomy.
